SHOULD INCLUDE:
- A single Header component that appears on multiple pages
- A single Navigation component within the header that will be used to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio
- A single Project component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section
- A single Footer component that appears on multiple pages
- The contact form should be similar to the one you built in the module project. Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, you can set up this functionality the same way you did in the module project and add in back-end functionality after you’ve covered it in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider adding your email address and phone number on the Contact page.
PROJECTS:
For each project you feature in your portfolio, you should include the following:
- An image of the deployed application (either a GIF or a screenshot)
- The title of the project
- A link to the deployed application
- A link to the corresponding GitHub repository
DESIGN:
- Use mobile-first design.
- Choose a color palette so that your site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. Look into resources like Coolors (Links to an external site.) or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.
- Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
- Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it may impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.
SUBMISSION:
- The URL of the functional, deployed application.
- The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
