# Portfolio - take II: React

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository

THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter) 

SHOULD INCLUDE:
- A single Project component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

PROJECTS:
For each project you feature in your portfolio, you should include the following:
- An image of the deployed application (either a GIF or a screenshot)
- The title of the project
- A link to the deployed application
- A link to the corresponding GitHub repository
DESIGN:
- Use mobile-first design.
- Choose a color palette so that your site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. Look into resources like Coolors (Links to an external site.) or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.
- Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
- Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it may impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.
SUBMISSION:
- The URL of the functional, deployed application.
- The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
